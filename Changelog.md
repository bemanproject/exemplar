- [LIBRARY_STATUS]: Library status updated to [Under development and not yet ready for production use.](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/main/docs/BEMAN_LIBRARY_MATURITY_MODEL.md#under-development-and-not-yet-ready-for-production-use):
This library will always be under development and not yet ready for production use,
